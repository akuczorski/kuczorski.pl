<p class="text-justify" style="text-indent: 10%; ">   Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.  Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.  There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.  And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.  Thankfully, we are born to learn.  Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.  Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.  Until one day, you walk.  One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.  Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.  Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.  <em>This is learning.</em>  It’s not that you don’t get it.  You just don’t get it, yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand. Whoever you are, wherever you are. 
You only have to know one thing:  <strong>You can learn anything</strong></p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
