 <div class="text-justify"><div style="text-indent: 7%; ">I'm cloud enthusiast with <strong>business</strong> and <strong>technical</strong> background, passionate about: cloud technology, cloud economics, business development, channel management, sales management and strategy. Throughout my career I was lucky enough to work for couple of high profile companies covering regional positions (see the details on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}">LinkedIn</a>). </div><br><P><h5>I believe we live on planet Earth to learn, therefore A.B.L. (Always Be Learning) is my principle.</h5></P> On professional area it translates into effort to constantly learn and keep the balance between management and technical side of things. For me this is the way to be credible as a manager and simply feel comfortable. Iâ€™m certified from variety of cloud vendors as well as having thorough experience in creating and successfully applying <strong>sales</strong> and <strong>cloud transformation</strong> strategies. Currently I work at Oracle as a <strong>CEE Cluster Lead </strong>responsible for Cloud Initiatives and <strong>Chief Cloud Officer</strong> for Poland.</div>
